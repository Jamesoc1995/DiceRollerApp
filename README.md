# DiceRollerApp
A small App based on combat mechanics of a board game, Dungeons and Dragons.

A 20 sided die will be rolled. Everytime it is rolled, the varibles strBonus and prof will be added.
If those numbers are greater than or equal to ac, then the programme will roll a 10 sided die to determane how much damage the enemy takes.
If 20 was rolled on the 20 sided die, the damage the enemy takes from the 10 sided dice is doubled.

Everytime the damage die is rolled, the enemy will lose health equal to the roll.

if the 20 sided die roll including strBonus and prof doesn't equal ac, then the attack missed.

the programme will loop fifty times or until the enemy loses all their health (hp varible).
